<p>Chu is an ancient state at the current mid-south mainland China.
    It was a free state, but it got destoryed by Qin, the first Chinese Empire.
    The Chu people values their freedom and have prophecy : “It must be Chu
    people who destory Qin even there are only three Chu families left”.
    Its glorious and repectful noble - Xiang Ji led the revolt against Qin
    and destoryed Empire Qin.

<h2>Free Chu</h2>
<p>Chu people have lost their freedom for long time. The modern Chu people
    claim their freedom during downfall of Empire Qing. The Japaness is friend
    and protector of Chu. With Japaness defeated in WWII, the Chu people lost
    their freedom to communist from Soviet Union. The yellow russian dominate
    the land of Chu since 1927. The Chu people are desperate for their freedom.

<h3>Chu Community</h3>
<p>There are many Chu people across world. Chu people are free to choose
    religion. Chu people must renounce communist, or the person does not
    belong to Chu community.
